When things are going well we tend to forget what it was like before. We live in a better world where things happen and we feel good. We don't generally plan for the inevitable loose shoe that causes us to get thrown from our steed.

So when we find ourselves face down in the mud no longer the most popular choice we need to face the reality. Accept our fall from grace. Pick ourselves up, brush ourselves down and start to analyse what went wrong.

The long hard look at the consequences of our demise should teach us a lesson.

We return again to the fight a stronger, wiser person. Plan for the inevitable falls and you will make better plans and chart a better course for the new you.
